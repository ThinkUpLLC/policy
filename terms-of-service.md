Hi and welcome! You are now reading ThinkUp's Terms of Service. This is the 
legal contract between you and ThinkUp when you use ThinkUp's site, services, 
and products. You should read this carefully before you use our site, our 
services or products. We've tried to be both fair and clear -- if you have any 
suggestions for improvement, feel free to email us at help@thinkup.com. We've 
also included annotations throughout this contract; these annotations aren't a 
part of the contract itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and 
to emphasize key sections.

1. Accepting the Terms of Service

  "We are ThinkUp and you're agreeing to these terms."

  These are some of the definitions we'll use in this contract:

  * "Services": ThinkUp.com and/or the other domains, products, services, and/or
    content provided by ThinkUp LLC.
  * "ThinkUp": ThinkUp LLC., a Delaware limited liability company. Also known 
    as "we" or "us".
  * "Subscriber": That is you, who we'll also call "you".

  By creating a Services Account or using or accessing the Services, you agree 
  to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including 
  agreement between you and ThinkUp in Section 15 to arbitrate certain claims

  ThinkUp may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this Agreement 
  (“Changes”) at any time.  Changes will be effective: (i) thirty (30) days 
  after ThinkUp provides notice of the Changes, whether such notice is 
  provided through the Services user interface, is sent to the e-mail address 
  associated with your Services account or otherwise; or (ii) when you opt-in 
  or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of this Agreement 
  incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first.

    maintain the service or to make necessary updates to the service. ThinkUp
    may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time,
    including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content

    Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a
    virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the
    Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden
    on the Services.

9. Warranty Disclaimer; Services Available on an "AS-IS" Basis

  "We want ThinkUp to be great for you, but it's not warrantied."

  YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
  THE SERVICES AND ANY ANALYTICS PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR
  INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND THINKUP IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY 
  ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS BASED ON SUCH ANALYTICS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT 
  THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. 
  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THINKUP 
  DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR 
  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. ThinkUp makes no representations

  uninterrupted or error-free or operate in combination with any other 
  hardware, software, system or data, (b) meet your requirements or 
  expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will be corrected, or 
  (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components. ThinkUp also makes no 
  representations or warranties of any kind with respect to Content; Subscriber 
  Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the responsibility of, 
  the Subscribers providing that Content. No advice or information, whether 
  oral or written, obtained from ThinkUp or through the Services, will create 
  any warranty not expressly made herein.

10. Release From Liability

  "We're not liable for certain issues that could arise from using ThinkUp."

  You release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, ThinkUp, its directors,
  officers, members, employees, representatives, consultants, agents,
  suppliers, and/or distributors from responsibility, liability, claims,
  demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature,
  known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the
  following:

    - Disputes between Subscribers, including those between you and other
      Subscribers.

    - Third party sites and services, including content found on such sites
      and services.

    - Disputes concerning any use of or action taken using your Account by you
      or a third party.

      Subscriber Content stored under or relating to your Account, including 
      unauthorized use or alteration of such communications or your Subscriber
      Content.

  You hereby waive applicability of California Civil Code §1542, and any 
  similar statute or principle of common law. California Civil Code §1542 says: 
  "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not 
  know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
  release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or 
  her settlement with the debtor."

11. Limitation of Liability

  "As much as the law allows, ThinkUp and its team isn't liable for certain
  types of damages. ThinkUp's total liability to you is limited, too."

  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THINKUP, ITS DIRECTORS,
  OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS,
  SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY 
  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
  KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) LOSS OF: PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR 
  OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR 
  USE THE SERVICES; (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD 
  PARTY OR SUBSCRIBER USING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
  DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT; AND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN 
  ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY SUBSCRIBER CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL 
  CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, 
  WHETHER OR NOT THINKUP HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, 
  AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS 
  ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF
  THINKUP AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, 
  CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM 
  UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE 
  GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE 
  PPLICABLE SERVICE(S).

12. Exclusions to Warranties and Limitation of Liability

  "We follow the law of your region in regard to warranties and liabilities."

  Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
  exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 14, so the
  limitations above may not apply to you.

13. Legal Compliance; Indemnification

  "You won't use ThinkUp to do illegal things."

  As a condition of your use of the Services, you represent and warrant that 
  you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited 
  by this Agreement. Access to the Services from territories where their 
  contents are illegal is strictly prohibited. You agree to comply with all 
  rules, laws, and regulations relating in any way to your use of the Services 
  including, without limitation, rules about intellectual property rights, the 
  Internet, technology, data, email and privacy.

  You agree to indemnify and hold ThinkUp, and its directors, officers, 
  members, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, suppliers, 
  licensors and/or distributors, harmless from and against any demands, 
  suits, actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, 
  settlements, costs or expenses, including attorney’s fees, arising out of or 
  relating to your use or misuse of the Services, violation of this Agreement 
  or violation of the rights of any other person or entity.  


14. Termination

  "If you want to cancel this agreement, just cancel your account. Same goes
  for us."

  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the other
  party. ThinkUp may also terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use
  any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
  reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the
  terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, ThinkUp may immediately
  terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright
  infringement.

  Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including
  but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to
  use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All
  provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive
  termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
  ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
  Termination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you
  of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit
  any liability which you otherwise may have to ThinkUp or any third party.

15. Arbitration

  "If there's a dispute, we'll arbitrate instead of going to court."

  “We will arbitrate certain disputes instead of going to court.”
  Any claim where the total amount of the award sought by either you or ThinkUp 
  is less than $10,000 shall be resolved via binding non-appearance-based 
  arbitration initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). 
  The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 
  1-800-778-7879. In any such arbitration, the parties and AAA must comply 
  with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by 
  telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific 
  manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the 
  arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or 
  witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; (c) the arbitrator 
  may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual 
  party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief 
  warranted by that party's individual claim; and (d) any judgment on the award 
  rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent 
  jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (1) either party 
  may seek remedies in small claims court of competent jurisdiction and (2) 
  either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of 
  competent jurisdiction.

16. Jurisdiction

  "This agreement is covered by New York law.  If there is a dispute between us 
  not subject to arbitration, we'll handle it in New York."

  Before resorting to litigation, we strongly encourage you to contact us at 
  help@thinkup.com to seek a resolution.
  
  This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of 
  New York as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed 
  entirely within New York between New York residents, without regard to 
  conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have 
  against ThinkUp that isn’t subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 14 
  must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York 
  County, New York, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. Each party 
  agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within 
  New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or 
  disputes.

17. Special Provisions for Subscribers Located Outside of the United States

  "We're in the United States, so we'll follow U.S. law."

  ThinkUp provides global products and services and enables a global community 
  for individuals. ThinkUp's operations are, however, located in the United 
  States, and ThinkUp's policies and procedures are based on United States 
  law. As such, the following provisions apply specifically to Subscribers 
  located outside of the United States: (1) you consent to the transfer, 
  storage, and processing of your information, including but not limited to 
  Subscriber Content and any personal information, to and in the United States 
  and/or other countries; and (2) if you are using the Services from a country 
  embargoed by the United States, or are on the United States Treasury 
  Department's list of "Specially Designated Nationals," you agree that you 
  will not use the Services.


18. Miscellaneous

  "This is the whole agreement between us."

  This Agreement, including as it may be modified from time to time as set 
  forth in Section 2 above, constitutes the entire agreement between you and 
  ThinkUp with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement replaces 
  all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, 
  regarding the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire and exclusive 
  agreement between the parties. The failure of either party to exercise in any 
  respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any 
  further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be 
  unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to 
  the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in 
  full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, 
  transferable, or sublicensable by you except with ThinkUp's prior written 
  consent. ThinkUp may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time 
  without your consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is 
  created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of 
  any kind to bind ThinkUp in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to ThinkUp 
  that is required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and 
  shall be deemed effective upon receipt, when delivered in person by 
  nationally recognized overnight courier or mailed by first class, registered 
  or certified mail, postage prepaid, to ThinkUp LLC., 220 East 23rd Street, 
  Suite 601, New York, NY, 10010, Attn: Legal Department. ThinkUp may provide
