  Definitions:

    For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term "Content" means a creative
    expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photographs,
    images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies,
    and comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable

  Ownership:

    Subscribers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in their
    Subscriber Content, and ThinkUp and/or third parties retain ownership of
    all intellectual property rights in all Content other than Subscriber
    Content.

  Content License to You:

    As a Subscriber of the Services, ThinkUp grants you a worldwide,
    non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to
    download, store, view, display, perform, redistribute, and create
    derivative works of Content solely in connection with your use of, and in
    accordance with the functionality and restrictions of, the Services
    (including, without limitation, Paid Services, as defined below). This

    of Subscriber Content from the Services, ThinkUp shall make reasonable

    however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or
    references to the Subscriber Content may not be immediately removed; (b)
    such removed Subscriber Content may persist in backups (not available to
    others) for a reasonable period of time; and (c) such removed Subscriber
    Content may be available (and stored on our servers) through the accounts
    of other Subscribers, such as because of Reblogging.

7. Use of Trademarks

  Any use of ThinkUp's trademarks, branding, logos and other such assets in
  connection with the Services shall be in accordance with the [ThinkUp
  Trademark Guidelines].

8. Paid Services

  Some of the Services require payment of fees (the "Paid Services," including
  without limitation Premium Themes). All fees are stated in United States
  dollars. You shall pay all applicable fees, as described in the applicable
  Services, in connection with such Services, and any related taxes or
  additional charges.

  Paid Services are limited licenses for you to use particular for-pay aspects
  of the Services. Usage of terms like sell, sale, buy, purchase, or similar
  terms all refer to your acquisition of a license to use Paid Services, and
  do not represent any transfer of any right, title, or ownership interest of
  any kind. You may not relicense, resell, transfer, or exchange Paid Services
  within or outside of the Services, except as expressly allowed by the rules
  of the Services.

  ThinkUp may, in its sole discretion, modify the functionality of, or
  eliminate, Paid Services, or the terms and conditions under which Paid
  Services are provided.

  Purchases of Paid Services are final and non-refundable (particularly those
  Paid Services that may be used immediately, such as Promotions, as defined
  below), except at ThinkUp's sole discretion and in accordance with the rules
  governing each such Paid Service. Termination of your Account or your rights
  under this Agreement may result in forfeiture of existing Paid Services. For
  example, if your Account is suspended, you forfeit your license to any
  Premium Themes you have purchased.

  ThinkUp may change its prices for Paid Services at any time. To the extent
  applicable, ThinkUp will provide you reasonable notice of any such pricing
  changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Paid Service
  and/or by sending you email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new
  prices, you may choose not to purchase, or to cancel, the applicable Paid
  Service prior to the change going into effect.

9. Warranty Disclaimer; Services Available on an "AS-IS" Basis

  Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk.
  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS"
  AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT
  PERMITTED BY LAW, THINKUP DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

  Services will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or operate in
  combination with any other hardware, software, system or data, (b) meet your
  requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will
  be corrected, or (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components. ThinkUp
  also makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to
  Content; Subscriber Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the
  responsibility of, the Subscribers providing that Content. No advice or
  information, whether oral or written, obtained from ThinkUp or through the
  Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.

10. Release From Liability

  You release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, ThinkUp, its directors,
  officers, shareholders, employees, representatives, consultants, agents,
  suppliers, and/or distributors from responsibility, liability, claims,
  demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature,
  known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the
  following:

    - Disputes between Subscribers, including those between you and other
      Subscribers.

      or a third party.

      Content stored under or relating to your Account, including unauthorized
      use or alteration of such communications or your Content.

  If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542,
  which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
  does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
  release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement
  with the debtor."

11. Limitation of Liability

  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THINKUP, ITS DIRECTORS,
  OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS,
  SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT,

  APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY
  OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THINKUP HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS
  FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF
  THINKUP AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES,
  REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS, FOR

  LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US
  TO USE THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S).

12. Exclusions to Warranties and Limitation of Liability

  Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
  exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 14, so the
  limitations above may not apply to you.

13. Termination

  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the other
  party. ThinkUp may also terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use
  any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
  reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the
  terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, ThinkUp may immediately
  terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright
  infringement.

  Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including
  but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to
  use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All
  provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive
  termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
  ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
  Termination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you
  of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit
  any liability which you otherwise may have to ThinkUp or any third party.

14. Legal Disputes

  You and ThinkUp agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or
  equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Services in accordance with

  agreement between you and ThinkUp with respect to the subject matter hereof.
  This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or
  agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and
  constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties. The
  failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
  herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any

  provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
  that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
  enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or

  "DMCA"). The address of ThinkUp's Designated Agent for copyright takedown
  notices ("Designated Agent") is listed below.

  Reporting Instances of Copyright Infringement:

    If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the
    Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright
    infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent
    at the address below:

      - Identification of the work or material being infringed.

      - Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing,
        including its location, with sufficient detail so that ThinkUp is
        capable of finding it and verifying its existence.

      - Contact information for the notifying party (the "Notifying Party"),
        including name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

      - A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the
        material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.

      - A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information
        provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is
        authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

      - A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
        behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly
        infringed.

    After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, ThinkUp will
    immediately notify the Subscriber responsible for the allegedly infringing
    material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. ThinkUp
    reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the
    account of any Subscriber who is the subject of repeated DMCA
    notifications.

  Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification:

    If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you
    may file a counter-notification with ThinkUp by providing the following
    information to the Designated Agent at the address below:

      - The specific URLs of material that ThinkUp has removed or to which
        ThinkUp has disabled access.

      - Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.

      - A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District
        Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or
        the federal district courts located in New York County, New York if
        your address is outside of the United States), and that you will
        accept service of process from the person who provided the original
        DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

      - The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I
        have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as
        a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be
        removed or disabled."

      - Your signature.

    Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, ThinkUp will forward it to
    Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original
    Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then
    have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action
    relating to the allegedly infringing material. If ThinkUp does not receive
    any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to
    the Services.
